= Project: Plant Dome ðŸŒµ

Control system and data gathering of hardware used in plant dome. The components required include:

x4 LEDs at different frequencies used by the plant for photosynthesis (I used x4 MOSFETs with resistors to switch)
5V DC pump (I used a BJT and 5V relay to switch)
Capacitive soil moisture sensor
Ethernet shield to upload telemetry to google sheets (if required)

== Step 1: Installation

This project is developed in Visual studio code using the Platform IO platform (https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

However any platform can be used to compile and flash code to the arduino. 

The following libraries must be installed to compile:

* Arduino.h
* Ethernet.h
* SPI.h

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit following the diagram Dome_Schematic.png (alternatively this can be opened in the Fritzing file Dome_Schematic.fzz if modifications need to be made)

== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board
